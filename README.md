# Workspacer version 0.8.0 for Symphony CMS version 2.5+

**Attention! This fork includes tweaks for my specific needs/setup, may not be suitable to your needs. Editor currently not working properly in Safari (16.4), but fine in Firefox.**

Workspacer allows files in the Workspace folder to be managed and edited. It also restores the ability, pre Symphony 2.4, to edit Page XSL templates from the Pages page.

## Requirements

Symphony CMS version 2.5 or higher, PHP 5.4 or higher.

## Installation

The folder needs to be named "workspacer". Install in the usual way for a Symphony extension.

## Usage

To access the file manager select 'Workspace' from the Blueprints menu.

To edit a file, click on the file name. Files can be saved by typing `Ctrl + s` or `Cmd + s` when the browser's focus is on the editing area. The 'Esc' key can be used to close the editor.

## Settings

On Symphony's Preferences page there are options to change some of the editor's properties.

## Browser Compatibility.

Versions 0.7 and 0.8 require Chrome/Chromium or one of its derivatives at the moment. This is due to the use of some recently added features in JavaScript.
